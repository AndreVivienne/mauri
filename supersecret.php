It's still early in the season I know...
<br><br>
But maybe the kid just isn't ready for the NHL yet? With the media hounding him, the pressure of being considered the next "great one", fuck I wouldn't be able to handle that shit.
<br><br>
Maybe having him in the minors for another year or two to develop a bit wouldn't have been a bad idea. The kid is only 18. At 18 I was complete fucktard who had no idea what I wanted to do.
<br><br>
Not much has changed... but I'd like to think I have a bit of a better head on my shoulders now.
<br><br>
I actually feel really bad for Mcdavid, and I hope we don't ruin him.
<br><br>
Edit: I'm being lynched for ever daring to doubt the greatness of Connor Mcdavid. How dare I say such blasphmey after only THREE games. You're right, he may only be 18 years old, but he has the emotional maturity of a Buddhist monk, and the body and athleticism as a top olympic athlete. He may have hit puberty only 3 to 4 years ago, but he is a grown man now, capable of all pressure and criticism that comes his way.
<br><br>
I am but a lowly neckbeard maple leafs fan who lives in my mothers basement here to shit on him for not getting 50 goals in his first 3 games. I am a rodent, and he is a golden god.
<br><br>
I'm going to go light myself on fire now. Thank you for showing me the error of my ways with you jamming the downvote arrow on your computer screen with all your might and telling me how much of an idiot I am.
